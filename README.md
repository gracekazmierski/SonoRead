# SonoRead

Craft the perfect soundtrack for your favorite books.

**SonoRead** is a web application that bridges the worlds of literature and music. It allows users to discover, create, and share music playlists that capture the mood and atmosphere of a specific book.

-   **Playlist Discovery:** Browse community-created playlists for any book.
-   **In-App Playback:** Listen to full songs directly in the app using the Spotify Web Playback SDK (Spotify Premium required).
-   **Playlist Creation:** Craft your own playlists by searching Spotify's entire library.
-   **Spotify Integration:** Import existing playlists from Spotify and export playlists created in SonoRead directly to your Spotify account.
